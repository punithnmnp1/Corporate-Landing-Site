Once the website is running, the sections will be prominently displayed at the top of the page. Users can engage with these section by:

**Read the headline to understand the main message or value proposition of the corporate website.**

Use the website's services. If you have any questions about the corporate form, you can submit it through the contact form. Corporate employees will clarify any doubts you have. The messages you send will be stored in Google Sheets so that corporate employees can easily understand and respond to your queries.

The webpage has a "get in touch" and "subscribe" option. The "get in touch" option allows users to submit their input and connect with corporate employees. The "subscribe" button allows corporate employees to see which users have liked the webpage and subscribed to it.

**index.html**: Update the hero heading, video/image, and call-to-action buttons.

**style.css**: Modify the styles for the hero section, such as background colors, typography, button styles, and scroll down indicator. Feel free to customize the code and design to align with your corporate unique identity and goals.

**subsrcibe.html**:This webpage will give details about subscribing to the particular website. 

**app.js**:This is a JavaScript file in which the MongoDB connection will be done.
